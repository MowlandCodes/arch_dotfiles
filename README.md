# Arch Linux Dotfiles Overview ‚ú®

Welcome to my personal Arch Linux dotfiles repository! This collection is meticulously crafted to provide a streamlined, efficient, and aesthetically pleasing computing environment. It leverages various open-source tools and configurations to enhance productivity and user experience on an Arch Linux system.

## üöÄ Usage

This repository is designed to be easily deployed using **GNU Stow**. GNU Stow is a symlink farm manager that helps you manage installations of multi-file software packages, such as dotfiles, in a clean and organized way.

**Here's how to use it:**

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/mowlandcodes/arch_dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
    ```
2.  **Navigate into the cloned directory:**
    ```bash
    cd ~/.dotfiles
    ```
3.  **Stow the desired dotfiles.** For example, to apply the Neovim configurations:
    ```bash
    stow nvim
    ```
    Or to apply all dotfiles:
    ```bash
    stow bash gtk nvim ranger rofi suckless
    ```
    This will create symlinks from your home directory to the respective configuration files in this repository.

After stowing, it's recommended to run the `post-install.sh` script for additional setup steps like installing required packages.
